For more informations about vDSO and why it's important in Linux you can see
[here](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vdso.7.html).

### #![no_std]

This library is entirely `no_std`.

# Code generation

All the code in `src/arch` is generated by the inner crate in the `vdso-gen`
directory so don't touch auto generated files please.
If you need to add or change something look in `defs` directory instead.
